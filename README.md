📌 Introduction

This project is designed to automatically scan your Gmail inbox and extract all PDF attachments using the Gmail API. Instead of manually searching through emails, the system securely connects to your Gmail account, retrieves messages based on custom filters, and downloads PDF files with ease.

It is especially useful for workflows that involve collecting invoices, reports, forms, or any PDF-based documents from email. The project uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and provides a lightweight, extensible structure that can be integrated into larger automation pipelines.
